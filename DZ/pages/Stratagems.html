        Stratagems in the Helldivers series are not merely additional abilities
        but the cornerstone of the entire gameplay and its philosophy. Calling
        them in by entering a unique combination of buttons or stick movements,
        reminiscent of inputting a code, turns each use into a deliberate
        tactical choice rather than a standard ability on cooldown. It is an
        elegant gamification of the idea of managing combat from orbit: the
        player acts as a strategist, requesting support at the most critical
        moment. From a powerful orbital strike to life-saving equipment or a
        turret, every stratagem requires time to "order" and deliver, adding
        layers of planning and foresight. The mechanic brilliantly enhances the
        cooperative spirit, as the team coordinates call-ins, covering each
        other during the input process. Thus, stratagems transform a chaotic
        shooter into a tense tactical operation where victory depends not only
        on accuracy but also on collective strategic thinking.
